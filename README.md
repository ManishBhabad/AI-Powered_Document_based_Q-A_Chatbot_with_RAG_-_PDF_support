##  How to Run Locally

1. **Install dependencies**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Install Ollama and pull Mistral model**
    ```
    ollama run mistral
    ```

3. **Start the Streamlit app**
    ```
    streamlit run financial_chatbot_ui.py
    ```

##  How It Works

- Extracts text from uploaded or preloaded PDFs using PyPDF2.
- Splits the text and creates vector embeddings with HuggingFace.
- Stores those embeddings in FAISS for semantic search.
- Uses Mistral LLM (via Ollama) to generate answers based on the retrieved content chunks.
- Displays answers in a friendly Streamlit interface.
